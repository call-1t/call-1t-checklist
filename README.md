# call-1t's Business & Investing Growth Tracker

This is a simple React-based interactive checklist that saves progress locally in your browser.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `checklist`:
   - Go to https://github.com/new and set **Repository name** to `checklist`.
   - Leave it public (or private if you prefer).

2. Upload the **contents** of this folder to the repository (drag & drop files in the GitHub web UI).

3. In your repository, go to **Settings â†’ Pages** (or `Settings â†’ Code and automation â†’ Pages`).
   - Under **Build and deployment**, set **Branch** to `main` and folder to `/ (root)` (if asked).
   - If GitHub asks to save, confirm and wait a minute or two.

4. Your site will be available at:
   `https://call-1t.github.io/checklist` (or similar; GitHub shows the exact link).

> Note: This project uses React from a CDN and Babel in the browser so **no build step** is required â€” just upload the files and enable Pages. If you ever want a build-based React project (with Vite), tell me and I can prepare that too.

## Local use

You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file). Progress will be saved in your browser's local storage.

## About

- Progress is saved locally; if you clear browser data you'll lose progress. Use Export to back up your JSON file.

Enjoy! ðŸš€
